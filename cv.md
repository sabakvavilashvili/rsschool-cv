##Couple things about me and my experience in programming:

1. When I finished school, I wanted to become a developer. I started studying Electrical Engineering in **Agruni Tbilisi** and parallel to that I was studying C++.

2. Then I wanted to move to **MACS** in Freeuni and I studied little bit of **Java**, but then I changed my mind, quit university and started studying **Javascript** on my own. Later on I found a job as a junior developer, but unfortunately they didn't pay me and in 2015 I completely quit coding.

3. The fact that I quit coding really bothered me for years and last year I decided to come back to coding and decided to start with Javascript. I took some courses on Codecademy and even downloaded some videos, but I've been doing other stuff and didn't really have time to push it really hard and then I found this course and I decided to go all in and really come back to coding. I think, that this course is a great opportunity.

4. I've had experience of coding, me and my brother even attended one of the Hackathons, but after that many years have passed and I forgot most of the stuff I knew and also of course, in 6 years, many many things have one thing I haven't forgotten and I think that's one of the most important things about coding is understanding the logic itself. But it's fair to say, that I know more, than
